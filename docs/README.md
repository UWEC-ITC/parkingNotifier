# Overview
The city of Eau Claire, WI receives, on average, 46" of snowfall per year. Naturally, snow emergencies are declared many times each winter. Alternate side parking is critical in helping snowplows clear residential roads on time.

In neighborhoods heavily populated by students, it's very common for students to receive tickets for not following the policy. The goal of this project is to decrease the number of tickets issued to students and increase the effectiveness of residential plowing.
