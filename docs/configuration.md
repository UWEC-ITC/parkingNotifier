# Running the project locally

### Prerequisites:

- Docker & docker-compose installed
- Node and npm installed

### Steps

1. At the root of the project run `docker-compose build`
2. Then run `docker-compose up`
3. With no errors, this will start the API on port 9000 and the front-end on port 3000.
